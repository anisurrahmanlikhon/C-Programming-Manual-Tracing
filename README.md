C Programming Manual Tracing is an open-source C coding tutorial recorder and player that efficiently replaces videos and screencasts for coding tutorials. Using different types of visualization modules, it enables the instructor to orally explain the entire code creation process while their interaction with a code editor and interpreter is recorded.C Programming Manual Tracing is when the programmer interprets the results of each line of code and keeps track by hand of the effect of each statement. This type of code tracing is often faster than using a debugger to step through (trace) the execution of a program.


C Programming Manual Tracing shows source code to trace and compile. 

- Identify and fix bugs.
- Conceptualize large-scale projects.
- Visualize dependencies.
- Collaborate with others.
- Onboard new software developers.
- Understand the user flow.


Programming24 School is a blog to visualize code is essential for clean, efficient, and effective development. When you’re working in the weeds of complex architectures, it is easy to lose sight of the big picture. You may have some outlines of your future state and a hierarchical filing system, but theoretical documents and a few folders don’t help you understand what your code looks like right now. Visual documentation of your code ensures you not only have the details organized but that they are conceptualized in a more accessible way.
