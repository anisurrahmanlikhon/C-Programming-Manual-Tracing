# C-Programming-Manual-Tracing
C Programming Manual Tracing is an open-source C coding tutorial recorder and player that efficiently replaces videos and screencasts for coding tutorials. Using different types of visualization modules, it enables the instructor to orally explain the entire code creation process while their interaction with a code editor and interpreter is recorded.

C Programming Manual Tracing is when the programmer interprets the results of each line of code and keeps track by hand of the effect of each statement. This type of code tracing is often faster than using a debugger to step through (trace) the execution of a program.
